A true Singapore landmark, it was gazetted as a national monument in 1973.   Distinctive design  Situated in the heart of the financial district, the market's distinctive octagonal shape and ornamental columns were first conceived by British architect George Coleman. He also designed many of colonial Singapore's prominent buildings that are still standing today, such as Old Parliament House. When the market had to be moved from its original waterfront location and rebuilt in 1894, Municipal Engineer of Singapore and Scotsman James MacRitchie retained its essential shape, but added a graceful clock tower and a new cast-iron supporting structure. The frames were cast in Glasgow before being shipped to and assembled in Singapore.   An architectural gem Today, after several facelifts and restorations (its most recent was in June 2014), what you see is still in line with MacRitchie's original vision. It is a marvel to observe how the soaring arches, fretted eaves and slender Victorian columns topped with intricate filigree work—wrought from the most solid iron—have achieved an airy, delicate lace-like effect. The market has long been converted into a hawker centre offering the best of local cuisine. So sip an ice-cold beer and enjoy a plate of Hainanese chicken rice as you revel in the elegant old-world charm of Singapore's loveliest food court.

") (activityShortContent "One of the most popular forms of local architecture must be the shophouse—those charming narrow units built in a row that speak to us of Asian heritage and culture more strongly than almost any other structure does.  So many styles Traditionally, a shophouse has a narrow frontage with a sheltered corridor at the front for pedestrians (called a five-foot way). They have internal courtyards, open stairwells and skylights to bring light and air into otherwise dark and narrow interiors. Shophouses here display different architectural influences, often depending on when they were built. Several periods have been identified when it comes to shophouse architecture. There is the minimalist approach taken in the Early Style with little to no ornamentation, the austere elegance of the Second Transitional Style and the streamlined modernity of the Art Deco period, which eschewed rich detailing and tiling for sleek columns and arches instead.  A brilliant mix It is the Late Style that is the most head-turning, with its bold use of colour and fancy tiles, as well as the eclectic mix of Chinese, Malay and European elements. Think of Chinese porcelain-chip friezes and bat-wing shaped air vents co-existing with Malay timber fretwork, French windows, Portuguese shutters and Corinthian pilasters. Neighbourhoods of Katong, Chinatown, Tanjong Pagar and Emerald Hill boast many fine examples of the shophouses described above.

Designed by Frank Dorrington Ward, chief architect of the Straits Settlements Public Works Department, it was the last classical building completed in Singapore and said to be one of Ward's greatest works.   Inspired by the Old Bailey  It is believed that his inspiration came from the Old Bailey Courthouse in London. It is easy to see the similarity, with the central dome backing the classical façade anchored by Corinthian and Ionic columns. The columns and the tympanum (the triangular piece over the columns) are of particular interest, created by Singapore-based Milanese sculptor Cavalieri Rudolfo Nolli and carved out of gypsum plaster.   Symbols of law and order The sculptures in the tympanum are dominated by the central figure of Justice. On the left, a figure represents the need for Mercy, while on the right, the Law is depicted by two legislators carrying books. Other figures symbolise Gratitude and Prosperity – the results of a system where law and order prevail.  The austere interior is a reminder that the building was built during the Great Depression. Gypsum plaster was used to finish the cornices and the main hall, while the Art Deco flooring was done in rubber, with the added advantage of absorbing loud noises.

Historic centre of attention Originally designed by architectural firm Keys & Dowdeswell and commissioned by the Namazie family, the Neoclassical Capitol Building was completed in 1933, four years after the Capitol Theatre. The adjoining theatre dominated the Singapore movie scene for decades after it opened as the premier cinema in the country. With its striking façade and portico facing the road junction, the building became the backdrop to one of Singapore's most recognisable street corners. Its giant billboards emblazoned with posters of the latest movies screening at Capitol Theatre attracted the attention of pedestrians and motorists alike and became as much of a beloved landmark itself. Today, the Capitol Theatre has become a venue for dance and theatrical productions, film screenings and red carpet movie premieres, with its original architectural details kept intact. It boasts an Art Deco entrance, a curved cantilevered canopy, a vaulted roof embellished with the 12 zodiac signs, as well as sculptures of winged horses and their riders flanking the stage.   Shopping and entertainment hub Upon the redevelopment of Capitol Building, Capitol Theatre and the neighbouring Stamford House and Capitol Centre, this cluster of buildings is now known collectively as Capitol Singapore.

It boasted a dining room with a marble floor, electric lights and powered ceiling fans—a first for any hotel in the region.  It became the place to be.

As the water in the reservoir remains calm all year around, it's ideal for some soaking wet fun, whether it's kayaking or, for the more team-spirited, a dragon boat race. If water sports is not your thing, head to the rooftop of the barrage, which boasts a green space that's popular for flying a kite, or just to chill out with the family.   The Marina Barrage also plays an important part in helping to alleviate flooding in some of the lower lying areas of the island. During periods of heavy rain, a series of nine crest gates will be opened to release excess storm water into the sea when the tide is low. When the tide is high, seven giant pumps that are capable of pumping an Olympic-sized swimming pool per minute whirr into action, draining water into the sea.  The facility is also a showcase for Singapore's push to be a greener country. The Solar Park, for instance, features one of the largest collections of solar panels in Singapore, with over 400 panels providing electricity needed for lighting at the barrage during the day.   To find out more about the country's efforts to go green, head to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery, which illustrates environmental and water issues through interactive multi-media displays, exhibits and games.  ") (activityImageUrl "http://www.visitsingapore.com/content/dam/desktop/global/see-do-singapore/architecture/marina-barrage-carousel01-rect.jpg ") (activityAddress "8 Marina Gardens Drive ") (activityPostalCode  18951 ) (activityLongitude  103.871397 ) (activityLatitude  1.280533 ) (activityStartTime  0000 ) (activityEndTime  2359 ) (activityMinimumAgeRange  No ) (activityLengthOfTime  3 ) (activityRegion  Central ) (activityProfile  Children  Adults  Elderly ) (activityMinimumBudget  10 ) (activitySuitableForYoungChildren   Yes ) (activitySuitableForElderly  Yes ) (activitySpecialNeeds  Yes ) (activitySheltered Both ) ( activityClosedDays "No ") )

Privacy, please Scheeren's plan was to break away from the usual form of the skyscraper. So he turned the vertical into the horizontal, breaking a building into blocks and rotating them at different angles such that each block would have privacy and a different view. The hexagonal arrangement also ensures that occupants can enjoy a balance between private and public spaces, preserving individuality even as it fosters a strong sense of community.

It houses what is reputedly the world's finest collection of Peranakan artefacts—such as jewellery, furniture and textiles—in ten permanent galleries over three floors.  Hands-on exhibits Various aspects of this hybrid Southeast Asian culture—made up of Chinese, Malay and Indian elements—are brought to life here, through the interactive and multimedia exhibits. Highlights include an elaborate 12-day Peranakan wedding, the stories of prominent Peranakans in Singapore's history and how today's Peranakans have evolved with their culture.  Rich heritage Their heritage is a tale of adaptation, after all. The term ‘Peranakan' means ‘locally born' in Malay, and refers to the descendants of foreign traders who married local women in Southeast Asia centuries ago. Singapore's Peranakan community is mostly Peranakan Chinese, descendants of Chinese traders who settled in the busy ports of Penang and Singapore in the 19th century.

His visit was closely watched, as it anticipated a change in local administration and the slashing of expenditure.  Inspired by a “needle” Designed by Government Surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, the Dalhousie Obelisk was built to remind merchants of the benefits of free trade.

At the ground floor, you'll find the Trade and the Exchange of Ideas gallery, which is home to artefacts and artworks that tell stories of Singapore's history as an emporium for global trade.   In the ACM's riverfront wing, resides the Khoo Teck Puat gallery, where visitors can find the famous Tang Shipwreck collection, a virtual time capsule of treasures from 9th-century China hidden from the world till its discovery in 1998. Then, head to the ground floor of the Kwek Hong Png Wing for the museum's first contemporary art space and be awe-struck by over 300 magnificent Chinese ceramics, from the museum's collection, on display at the third floor. Other galleries in the ACM include the Ancient Religions Gallery and the Scholar in Chinese Culture gallery.  The ACM is far more than just a spectacular history lesson. Expect programmes like the annual River Nights, where you can connect closely with culture and the arts.  After marvelling at all that history, you can also take time to reflect with a bite at Privé Café @ ACM or Cantonese restaurant, Empress. Then, exit through the gift shop and pick up some unique souvenirs to remember your trip to the ACM by.  ") (activityImageUrl "http://www.visitsingapore.com/content/dam/desktop/global/see-do-singapore/history/asian-civilizations-museum-carousel01-rect.jpg ") (activityAddress "1 Empress Place ") (activityPostalCode  179555 ) (activityLongitude  103.851375 ) (activityLatitude  1.287508 ) (activityStartTime  1000 ) (activityEndTime  1900 ) (activityMinimumAgeRange  22 ) (activityLengthOfTime  2 ) (activityRegion  Central ) (activityProfile  Adults  Elderly ) (activityMinimumBudget  10 ) (activitySuitableForYoungChildren   No ) (activitySuitableForElderly  Yes ) (activitySpecialNeeds  Yes ) (activitySheltered   Indoor ) ( activityClosedDays "No ") )
