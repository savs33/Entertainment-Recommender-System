") (activityShortContent "Built in the 19th century, Lau Pa Sat or Telok Ayer Market has long dominated the local landscape with its striking presence. A true Singapore landmark, it was gazetted as a national monument in 1973.   Distinctive design Â Situated in the heart of the financial district, the market's distinctive octagonal shape and ornamental columns were first conceived by British architect George Coleman. He also designed many of colonial Singapore's prominent buildings that are still standing today, such as Old Parliament House. When the market had to be moved from its original waterfront location and rebuilt in 1894, Municipal Engineer of Singapore and Scotsman James MacRitchie retained its essential shape, but added a graceful clock tower and a new cast-iron supporting structure. The frames were cast in Glasgow before being shipped to and assembled in Singapore.   An architectural gem Today, after several facelifts and restorations (its most recent was in June 2014), what you see is still in line with MacRitchie's original vision. It is a marvel to observe how the soaring arches, fretted eaves and slender Victorian columns topped with intricate filigree workâ€”wrought from the most solid ironâ€”have achieved an airy, delicate lace-like effect. The market has long been converted into a hawker centre offering the best of local cuisine. So sip an ice-cold beer and enjoy a plate of Hainanese chicken rice as you revel in the elegant old-world charm of Singapore's loveliest food court.

") (activityShortContent "One of the most popular forms of local architecture must be the shophouseâ€”those charming narrow units built in a row that speak to us of Asian heritage and culture more strongly than almost any other structure does.  So many styles Traditionally, a shophouse has a narrow frontage with a sheltered corridor at the front for pedestrians (called a five-foot way). They have internal courtyards, open stairwells and skylights to bring light and air into otherwise dark and narrow interiors. Shophouses here display different architectural influences, often depending on when they were built. Several periods have been identified when it comes to shophouse architecture. There is the minimalist approach taken in the Early Style with little to no ornamentation, the austere elegance of the Second Transitional Style and the streamlined modernity of the Art Deco period, which eschewed rich detailing and tiling for sleek columns and arches instead.  A brilliant mix It is the Late Style that is the most head-turning, with its bold use of colour and fancy tiles, as well as the eclectic mix of Chinese, Malay and European elements. Think of Chinese porcelain-chip friezes and bat-wing shaped air vents co-existing with Malay timber fretwork, French windows, Portuguese shutters and Corinthian pilasters. Neighbourhoods of Katong, Chinatown, Tanjong Pagar and Emerald Hill boast many fine examples of the shophouses described above.

Designed by Frank Dorrington Ward, chief architect of the Straits Settlements Public Works Department, it was the last classical building completed in Singapore and said to be one of Ward's greatest works.   Inspired by the Old Bailey Â It is believed that his inspiration came from the Old Bailey Courthouse in London. It is easy to see the similarity, with the central dome backing the classical faÃ§ade anchored by Corinthian and Ionic columns. The columns and the tympanum (the triangular piece over the columns) are of particular interest, created by Singapore-based Milanese sculptor Cavalieri Rudolfo Nolli and carved out of gypsum plaster.   Symbols of law and order The sculptures in the tympanum are dominated by the central figure of Justice. On the left, a figure represents the need for Mercy, while on the right, the Law is depicted by two legislators carrying books. Other figures symbolise Gratitude and Prosperity â€“ the results of a system where law and order prevail.  The austere interior is a reminder that the building was built during the Great Depression. Gypsum plaster was used to finish the cornices and the main hall, while the Art Deco flooring was done in rubber, with the added advantage of absorbing loud noises.

The property was bought over by Father Beurel in 1853, in addition to surrounding parcels of land, for the purpose for building a girls' school.

Historic centre of attention Originally designed by architectural firm Keys & Dowdeswell and commissioned by the Namazie family, the Neoclassical Capitol Building was completed in 1933, four years after the Capitol Theatre. The adjoining theatre dominated the Singapore movie scene for decades after it opened as the premier cinema in the country. With its striking faÃ§ade and portico facing the road junction, the building became the backdrop to one of Singapore's most recognisable street corners. Its giant billboards emblazoned with posters of the latest movies screening at Capitol Theatre attracted the attention of pedestrians and motorists alike and became as much of a beloved landmark itself. Today, the Capitol Theatre has become a venue for dance and theatrical productions, film screenings and red carpet movie premieres, with its original architectural details kept intact. It boasts an Art Deco entrance, a curved cantilevered canopy, a vaulted roof embellished with the 12 zodiac signs, as well as sculptures of winged horses and their riders flanking the stage.   Shopping and entertainment hub Upon the redevelopment of Capitol Building, Capitol Theatre and the neighbouring Stamford House and Capitol Centre, this cluster of buildings is now known collectively as Capitol Singapore.

Named after Singapore's founder, Sir Stamford Raffles, the hotel was built by the Sarkies Brothers, responsible for other luxury hotels in the region during the colonial era. Although Raffles Singapore opened in 1887, its layout continued to be changed, with hotel wings, suites and other facilities added over the years.   Jewel in the crown However, it was the hotel's new main building, designed by R. A. J. Bidwell of Swan & MacLaren and completed in 1899, which turned out to be the jewel in the crown. An exemplary showcase of neo-Renaissance architecture, tropical touches like high ceilings and extensive verandahs were added. It boasted a dining room with a marble floor, electric lights and powered ceiling fansâ€”a first for any hotel in the region.  It became the place to be. Somerset Maugham, Herman Hesse and Rudyard Kipling were just some of the illustrious names that spent a night or two under its roof. A facelift in 1989 restored it to the height of its glory. An original cast-iron portico and a timber staircase were reinstated, while decorative plasterwork was painstakingly repaired.

Locals have dubbed them 'the Durian', as the twin structures resemble the spiky tropical fruit that is unique to this part of the world. And as with the strong, some might say pungent, smelling national fruit of Singapore, every Singaporean has an opinion about the bold design of Esplanade. Love it or not, the space has become synonymous with the country, a funky complement to the symmetry of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer that sit nearby.  Designed by leading local firm DP Architects, the space features a 1,600-seat Concert Hall where the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and other local, regional and international music acts regularly perform.  If you're in the mood for some Shakespeare or perhaps a modern dance performance, chances are you'll find it at the 2,000-seat Theatre next door.Â The centre also houses a Recital Studio, Theatre Studio, an Outdoor Theatre, Annexe Studio and visual art exhibition spaces that round off the arts offerings.

") (activityShortContent "For a dose of education mixed with fun in the sun and recreation on the water, the Marina Barrage gives you all that and more. In Singapore, even something as common as a reservoir can be turned into a hotspot for recreational activities. Built across the mouth of the 350-metre wide Marina Channel, the Marina Barrage creates the country's 15th reservoir, supplying around 10% of the nation's water needs.  As the water in the reservoir remains calm all year around, it's ideal for some soaking wet fun, whether it's kayaking or, for the more team-spirited, a dragon boat race. If water sports is not your thing, head to the rooftop of the barrage, which boasts a green space that's popular for flying a kite, or just to chill out with the family.Â   The Marina Barrage also plays an important part in helping to alleviate flooding in some of the lower lying areas of the island. During periods of heavy rain, a series of nine crest gates will be opened to release excess storm water into the sea when the tide is low. When the tide is high, seven giant pumps that are capable of pumping an Olympic-sized swimming pool per minute whirr into action, draining water into the sea.  The facility is also a showcase for Singapore's push to be a greener country. The Solar Park, for instance, features one of the largest collections of solar panels in Singapore, with over 400 panels providing electricity needed for lighting at the barrage during the day.Â   To find out more about the country's efforts to go green, head to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery, which illustrates environmental and water issues through interactive multi-media displays, exhibits and games.Â  ") (activityImageUrl "http://www.visitsingapore.com/content/dam/desktop/global/see-do-singapore/architecture/marina-barrage-carousel01-rect.jpg ") (activityAddress "8 Marina Gardens Drive ") (activityPostalCode  18951 ) (activityLongitude  103.871397 ) (activityLatitude  1.280533 ) (activityStartTime  0000 ) (activityEndTime  2359 ) (activityMinimumAgeRange  No ) (activityLengthOfTime  3 ) (activityRegion  Central ) (activityProfile  Children  Adults  Elderly ) (activityMinimumBudget  10 ) (activitySuitableForYoungChildren   Yes ) (activitySuitableForElderly  Yes ) (activitySpecialNeeds  Yes ) (activitySheltered Both ) ( activityClosedDays "No ") )

Built on the site of Singapore's oldest HDB blocks, its design and construction is aimed at revitalising the area and commemorating its historical significance. A design competition was held and won by two local architectural firms, who worked together to create simple and elegant residences, using precast technology. Completed in 2009, the Pinnacle@Duxton stands out as an example of how HDB confronts the challenges of meeting housing needs in an urban setting, with innovative solutions that address the social, physical and economic issues of public housing. Its seven 50-storey high towers rise as high as skyscrapers and are linked at the 26th and 50th levels by skybridges. It is the HDB's first residential project with sky bridges connecting the towers.   High in the sky Each skybridge is home to a 500-metre-long sky garden. In fact, a few records are set by Pinnacle@Duxton: the world's tallest public housing buildings and longest sky gardens. The development has also won many awards, including the 2010 Best Tall Building Asia and Australasia award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat as well as the President's Design Award For Design of the Year 2010.

The right angles At The Interlace, apartment blocks are stacked in a seemingly haphazard way, twisting at angles so that they do not form a straight line. Each of the 31 blocks are identical in height, standing at six-storeys tall. The effect is unusual yet pleasing to the eye, with the odd jutting corners providing space for lush roof gardens, sky terraces and large balconies with cascading greenery. It's certainly unlike anything you've seen before in Singapore. This was designed by German architect Ole Scheeren, known for conceptualising some of the world's most head-turning buildings, like the CCTV headquarters in Beijing.   Privacy, please Scheeren's plan was to break away from the usual form of the skyscraper. So he turned the vertical into the horizontal, breaking a building into blocks and rotating them at different angles such that each block would have privacy and a different view. The hexagonal arrangement also ensures that occupants can enjoy a balance between private and public spaces, preserving individuality even as it fosters a strong sense of community. His groundbreaking vision may yet prove to set a precedent for many, seeking to balance the demands of space and privacy in increasingly dense cities, where both qualities are fast becoming a luxury.
