") (activityShortContent "Pop by Esplanade at any time and you'll find it hard not to be infected by its palpable creative vibe, whether it's the ever-changing larger than life visual arts display near the main entrance or the world-class performances staged here.  The shows featured cut across cultures and genres. You can catch a concert by Western greats such as The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra or a Chinese play inspired by the late doyen of Singapore Chinese theatre Kuo Pao Kun.  Fondly nicknamed 'the Durianâ€� by Singaporeans for its resemblance to the popular fruit here, Esplanade holds a 1,600-seat Concert Hall, a 2,000-seat Theatre and several more intimate performance venues, and has hosted high-profile events such as the return of the quintessential musical Les MisÃ©rables.  Free programmes, from music and dance to theatre, also regularly take place at various locations in Esplanade.  Shopping and dining Before you attend a performance, catch a pre-show dinner or a coffee at one of the restaurants or cafes at the three-storey Esplanade Mall, including the newest addition the Esplanade Annexe. You can also squeeze in a quick spot of shopping at the retail outlets, picking up goods as diverse as customised hand lotions, or maybe a violin or two.  If you wish to explore the complex further, take the Esplanade Walk, a 45-minute guided tour that takes you through the Concert Hall, Theatre and other front-of-house facilities. The tour will give you an understanding of the venue's acoustics, its architecture and history, as well as its contribution to Singapore's art scene.

") (activityShortContent "The grande dames of Singapore's performing arts scene, home toÂ the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), didn't start off as a purpose-built theatre. Instead, it was completed in 1862 as a Town Hall with a theatre, but became too small for either function. In 1901, it was decided that a memorial hall was to be built to commemorate Queen Victoria, who passed away in January that year, and that the Town Hall would be incorporated into the design of the memorial hall. The Victoria Memorial Hall was built next to the Town Hall, the facades were unified in the Palladian architectural style and a clock tower erected to join the two buildings together. The Town Hall was renamed Victoria Theatre. Today, it stands as an iconic landmark in Singapore's city centre.  A new beginning In 1979, a gallery was added, the Victoria Memorial Hall was renamed the Victoria Concert Hall and the SSO took up residence there. But even grande dames need to constantly renew themselves, evident in the recent renovation that improved acoustics and facilities while preserving facade and heritage elements.

Depending on the season, you will find a diverse range of artists and events, from young poets to established visual artists and local rock bands as well as international short film festivals on its programme line-up. The first independent arts centre established in Singapore, The Substation was founded in September 1990 by Chinese theatre director and writer Kuo Pao Kun. The centre derives its name from the conservation building it now occupies, a former power substation built in 1926.  Experimenting with space The venue houses two main performance areasâ€”a 108-seater black box theatre and a 113 m2 white cube visual art space known as The Substation Gallery. But in line with the experimental tone of the site, many artists have come up with novel uses of the centre's other spaces, for example, staging plays in the gallery space, or even using areas such as the stairwells and the rooftops for artistic presentations. Art and photography classes are also conducted here. If you're after a spot of light entertainment, drop by Timbre, the bar and bistro in The Substation's open-air garden, which features nightly live gigs by local bands as well as visiting artistes.

") (activityShortContent "A picture of the past Named after General Sir Webb Gillman, a well-known officer of the British Army, Gillman Barracks was built in 1936. It was home to army barrack buildings, married quarters and even recreational facilities, built specially for the British's 1st Battalion before World War II. During World War II, the Barracks and its surrounding area was one of Singapore's last battle sites before her fall. Fortunately, the site survived the war when Singapore regained British rule in September 1945. Even after Singapore's independence, Gillman Barracks was a key site used by the Singapore Armed Forces for the training of national service men. Following a round of restoration, in September 2012, the Barracks was launched as a cluster of international art galleries and other art-related tenants, giving rise to Singapore's Contemporary Art Enclave.  A day out with contemporary art Spend a day at Gillman Barracks being immersed in some of the finest contemporary art from around the world. Tucked away from the city centre's hustle and bustle, the Barracks' colonial architecture and tranquil tropical surroundings make for an inspiring encounter with contemporary art. International galleries such as Sundaram Tagore Gallery and Mizuma Gallery have set up alongside home grown galleries such as FOST Gallery and Yavuz Gallery. Together, the galleries represent a spectacular array of both established and emerging artists such as Ai Wei Wei, Gilbert & George, Indieguerillas, Yayoi Kusama, Jane Lee, and Sebastiao Salgado. Exhibitions are ever-changing and showcase the depth and variety of contemporary art practices.Also don't miss the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) Singapore, a research centre that has three intertwining platforms of exhibitions, residencies and research. The NTU CCA Singapore encourages critical discourse and experimental contemporary art practices in Singapore and beyond, and is a must-visit destination within Gillman Barracks.  In between gallery-hopping, refuel at one of the six restaurants, cafÃ©s and bars onsite.
