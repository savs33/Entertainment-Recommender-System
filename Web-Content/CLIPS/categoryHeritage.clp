") (activityShortContent "It's safe to say that the Peranakan Museum is the go-to destination for Peranakan (Straits-born people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage) heritage and culture. It houses what is reputedly the world's finest collection of Peranakan artefacts—such as jewellery, furniture and textiles—in ten permanent galleries over three floors.  Hands-on exhibits Various aspects of this hybrid Southeast Asian culture—made up of Chinese, Malay and Indian elements—are brought to life here, through the interactive and multimedia exhibits. Highlights include an elaborate 12-day Peranakan wedding, the stories of prominent Peranakans in Singapore's history and how today's Peranakans have evolved with their culture.  Rich heritage Their heritage is a tale of adaptation, after all. The term ‘Peranakan' means ‘locally born' in Malay, and refers to the descendants of foreign traders who married local women in Southeast Asia centuries ago. Singapore's Peranakan community is mostly Peranakan Chinese, descendants of Chinese traders who settled in the busy ports of Penang and Singapore in the 19th century.  Conserved neoclassical building The Peranakan Museum is housed in a handsome old school. Now a National Monument, the former Tao Nan School was built in 1912, and was the first modern Hokkien school set up in the Straits Settlements. A little-known fact: The building's layout is based on Straits Settlements bungalows, where rooms sit around a central hall while toilets and kitchens are outside the main building.

") (activityShortContent "A Peranakan (Straits-born people of Chinese and Malay/Indonesian heritage) heritage house with exhibits just as vibrant as its bright blue exterior, NUS Baba House is a fantastic journey into the early 20th century home of a prominent Straits Chinese family. Once the ancestral home of shipping tycoon Wee Bin, this pre-war terrace house is one of the few traditional Peranakan shophouses in Singapore with its elaborate original interiors still intact.  Careful restoration The National University of Singapore acquired and restored the house, thanks to a donation by Agnes Tan, the youngest daughter of renowned Malacca-born businessman and community leader Tun Tan Cheng Lock. After a two-year restoration, NUS Baba House opened in 2008. Today, it is managed by the university, which sent in researchers to preserve its exterior and interiors architecture, including furnishing and household wares. Archaeologists and art historians from the university had the opportunity to carry out excavations and a study on the iconography of the building's ornamentation.   Rich glimpses You'll find these artefacts among the more than 2,000 Peranakan antiques and decorative items displayed on the first and second floors. Don't miss the temporary exhibitions on Peranakan themes at the gallery on the third floor.

The Eurasian Heritage Centre explores their history and culture through different exhibitions at its three heritage galleries as well as special activities.  Home in Katong The Eurasian community is one of Singapore's smallest, but also one of its earliest. Known for their hybrid traditions of East and West, their Asian and European origins can be traced to some of the region's oldest colonial settlements, such as Malacca, Penang, Goa, Macau and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Eurasian Heritage Centre within the Eurasian Community House lies in the heart of vibrant Katong, where many Eurasians called home from the early 20th century.  Heritage, food and song Here's where you can discover more about the community's most prominent personalities from sports, music and politics, for instance, and find out more about its origins, unique celebrations, language and even clothes. World War II buffs will also be intrigued by how Eurasian families lived through the Japanese Occupation. If you have the chance, take part in a Portuguese folk-dance workshop. Ask for the classic song 'Jinkli Nona', a traditional Portuguese Malaccan folk song. Foodies will enjoy sampling traditional Eurasian fare at the Eurasian Community House's in-house restaurant.

Set within three beautifully-restored shophouses on Pagoda Street, the Chinatown Heritage Centre recreates the original interiors of the 1950s, offering a rare glimpse into the lives of Chinatown's early residents.  At the centre you can explore the living quarters, shops and even nightlife of these early settlers. Every object here tells a story, providing a fascinating insight into some of the people who helped build this modern city.  You can retrace the journey of those who left their villages in China to escape famine, floods and unrest and headed to Singapore to seek a better life. Most of them settled south of the Singapore River, giving birth to Chinatown.  Many of them risked their lives to get here, and you'll be able to get a first-hand view of what they endured as you explore the cosy rooms and narrow passages of the building.   The centre reopened in early 2016 after an extensive refurbishment, providing new temporary exhibition areas and space for community events. Even better, you can now sample renowned local food at Old Chang Kee's Curry Times, and pick up limited edition souvenirs by local designers such as Doe & Audrey and My Paper Earrings.   The refurbished centre also brings the Chinatown story up to date, with new exhibitions on the area from the 1960s onwards. It also features the fascinating tale of the Kongs, a family who used to live in the exact same building before it was transformed into the heritage centre you can enjoy now.   There has never been a better time to visit the Chinatown Heritage Centre.

But this wonderful theme park also has more, shall we say, tasteful scenes from other Chinese legends, such as Journey to the West and Madame White Snake. Pick your favourite from the over 1,000 colourful statues and tableaux on display, among them a giant gorilla and massive deity heads.  Other-worldly experience Located on a hill in Pasir Panjang, Haw Par Villa is named after the Burma-born Aw brothers, who created the medical ointment Tiger Balm. Created for his younger brother Boon Par, the older Boon Haw saw the S$2-million circular-shaped house and its sprawling garden as a journey into Chinese mythology. In its early years, the grounds were opened to the public, and even had a zoo. But when World War II broke out, the brothers abandoned the house and fled overseas. Japanese forces took over, using it to watch over ships at sea.  A grand revival After the war, Boon Par's son Aw Cheng Chye added the finishing touches to the park. Many visited in the 1970s and 1980s on day trips and school excursions—adult Singaporeans will cheekily tell you of the nightmares the park gave them as kids! In 1985, the Singapore Tourism Board acquired the land and gave the park a face lift. Now, you can hop on a guided tour that takes you on a trail of the world's only eclectic Chinese mythological park of its kind. Visitor discretion and parental guidance are advised for visitors to the “10 Courts of Hell” due to the graphic nature of the exhibits.

Step over its well-preserved threshold, and the hustle-and-bustle of office life disappears, making it a nice spot for quiet contemplation amid the area's shophouses and office buildings.  A former shrine The temple was originally a shrine dedicated to the Chinese deity, Tua Pek Kong, who is worshipped by Confucianists and Taoists. Set up between 1820 and 1824 by Cantonese and Hakka immigrants, the shrine was where many Chinese immigrants gave thanks for their safe journey to Singapore. As donations poured in, the temple was built in brick in 1825. It has been renovated several times, such as the 1869 complete renovation that was financed by Hokkien community leader Cheang Hong Lim.  Restored and redeveloped The temple later became the headquarters for the Cantonese and Hakka communities, even functioning as welfare associations where disputes were settled. But by the 1990s, this colourful history had crumbled and the temple was in disrepair. It was handed over to the government and the temple moved to a shrine in Geylang. Craftsmen from China and Malaysia restored it completely and it became a museum in 1998.

As the first and currently the only university research centre in the world outside China, the Centre specialises in the study of the overseas Chinese. The Centre has occupied a unique position serving as a bridge between the University and the community and is the only one-of-its-kind platform to launch research and community outreach projects.   The Nantah legacy Set within Nanyang Technological University in Jurong West, the Centre's historic surroundings are perfectly suited to its cause.
