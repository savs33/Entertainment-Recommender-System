Unspoilt, rustic charm Still, the charms of the island will captivate you, as it remains largely authentic, unspoilt and rustic, right down to the occasional whiffs of wildlife. With an area of 10.2 square kilometres, this boomerang-shaped 1,020-hectare island sits just off the northeastern corner of mainland Singapore, in the Straits of Johor. See if you can spot the abandoned quarries on Pulau Ubin, which means Granite Island in Malay. The island no longer hosts the granite quarrying industry.  Wildlife encounters Today, instead of miners, you're more likely to bump into mynahs as well as other wildlife. Nature lovers flock here on weekends as Pulau Ubin supports a rich ecosystem teeming with flora and fauna as well as threatened species of birds. The star attraction is the Chek Jawa Wetlands. The intertidal flat comprises coral reefs, which are home to extensive marine wildlife, such as sea hares, sea squirts, octopuses, starfish, sand dollars, sponges and cuttlefish. Be warned that you could get used to the slow pace of life here – it's too easy to leave your worries behind. Getting to Pulau Ubin is easy – just a 10-minute bumboat ride from Changi Point Ferry Terminal.

The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a world-class eco-tourism experience first discovered in 1986 by a group of birdwatchers from the Malayan Nature Society. Three years later, the site was designated as a nature park by the Government in 1989, and officially opened in 1993. To properly experience the wetlands, you can take the free guided tours, while activities like art classes and a prawn farming demo will keep you busy the whole day.
