It became populated by a growing English-educated middle class, including Peranakans and Eurasians.   The neighbouring Joo Chiat area is named after Chew Joo Chiat, a wealthy Chinese landowner in the early 20th-century.

A look back By the 1850s, these humble origins had changed. People moved in, along with outdoor hawker centres, wet markets, cemeteries, temples, and even an open-air laundry basin. It was only in 1903 that Orchard Road's shops sprung up, with Singapore's first supermarket, where The Centrepoint now stands. The first department store was opened by local merchant C.K Tang in 1958 on a plot of land facing a cemetery. When it was demolished in 1982, it was replaced by the landmark Tang Plaza, which houses a local department store and hotel. In the 1970s, cinemas, a bowling alley and ever larger malls followed, and Orchard Road's reputation as an entertainment hub grew.
