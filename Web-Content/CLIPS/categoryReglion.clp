") (activityShortContent "With its massive golden domes and huge prayer hall, Sultan Mosque is a must-see if you're in the historic Kampong Glam district. Masjid Sultan, as it is also known, is a prominent mosque in Singapore and one of the country's most impressive religious buildings.  Fit for a king The mosque was built in 1824 for Sultan Hussein Shah, the first sultan of Singapore. Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, gave S$3,000 to the construction of a single-storey building with a double-tiered roof. A hundred years later, the old mosque was in desperate need of repair. The present mosque as you see it today was designed by Denis Santry from Swan and Maclaren, Singapore's oldest architectural firm, and rebuilt in 1932. A little-known fact is that during this reconstruction, North Bridge Road was actually forced to bend around the mosque as it was extended beyond Arab Street.  Glass base While you're there, look closer at the onion domes. Each dome base is decorated with glass bottle ends, donated by poor Muslims during its construction so that all Muslims, not just the rich, could contribute. Gazetted as a national monument in 1975, the mosque is a focal point for the Muslim community then as now. If you're there during Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, check out the night market in the area and its many food stalls. And do hop on the mosque's informative guided tours—guides can speak English, Malay, Chinese, and even Japanese.

") (activityShortContent "Step into one of Singapore's oldest Hindu temples, the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, dedicated to the goddess and destroyer of evil, Sri Veeramakaliamman or Kali. This distinctive landmark in the heart of Little India has fascinating stories to tell of colonial Singapore.  Early pioneers From its earliest days, it was linked with early migrant workers from India, who would have worshipped the goddess to feel safe in a new foreign land. One of its first names was Soonambu Kambam Kovil, or the “temple at the lime village” in Tamil. Many Indians who prayed at the temple worked in lime kilns in the area. Lime was a building material used back then. During the Japanese air raids in World War II, many people sought physical refuge at the temple as well as prayed for Kali's protection. As luck—or fate—would have it, the temple and all its statues escaped the bombings unscathed.  A spectacular experience In the 1980s, major reconstruction work took place, with a Rajagopuram (front tower) added as well as eight main domes and several other minor ones. The annexe building was also built at the back of the temple. It was again renovated in 1999, with the temple's consecration ceremony taking place in 2000. In June 2014, the temple had another consecration ceremony which marked the culmination of the major restoration works, as well as the construction of a new six-storey building with various new facilities including a wedding hall, multipurpose hall and staff quarters. With its colourful and intricate statues and detailing, the temple remains one of the most spectacular experiences in Singapore.

Dating back to 1827, the temple was known as Mariamman Kovil or Kling Street Temple, and built by immigrants from the Nagapatnam and Cuddalore districts of South India. It is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, known for her power to cure illnesses and diseases.  Abuzz with activity Now a national monument, much of the present structure is believed to have been built in 1862-1863 by Indian craftsmen. Besides worship, the temple was an important place for community activities during the colonial era. It was even the Registry of Marriages for Hindus—at the time, only the temple was authorised to solemnise Hindu marriages. It has been restored numerous times, most recently in 2010. This S$4-million restoration project saw a team of about 20 artists brought in from India, and included repainting all the stone deities.  An ornate landmark At the temple, look out for its ornate and elaborate detailing. The majestic gopuram (grand tower entrance) especially is a landmark to generations of Hindu worshippers and Singaporeans alike. Its six tiers are covered with sculptures of deities, mythological beasts and other beings. See if you can spot the Sepoy soldiers in their khaki uniforms from the military tradition of the British Raj. If you're here in October or November, consider observing the Theemithi (fire walking ceremony), which is the main festival celebrated annually at the temple.

But, along with its neighbour, Sri Mariamman Temple, Jamae Mosque has been a prominent landmark in South Bridge Road for nearly 200 years, often appearing in early illustrations, photographs and postcards.  A mosque for Chulia migrants Built in 1826, Jamae Mosque was the first of three mosques in Chinatown erected by the Chulias, who were Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast of Southern India. This is why it is also known as Masjid Chulia or Chulia Mosque. It is one of the few mosques in Singapore holding religious classes in Tamil today.  Eclectic style Said to be one of the oldest mosques in Singapore, Jamae Mosque has an eclectic architectural style, borrowing elements from both East and West. The entrance gate has a South Indian Indo-Islamic influence, while the prayer hall's neoclassical features include Doric columns and large windows with Chinese green-glazed tiles. The intricately designed palace facade has tiny doors and cross-shaped openings—worth a second look. In any case, this is the site to see early Singapore architecture in its original form.

Coleman's masterpiece Architecture buffs will appreciate that the church was designed by the prominent Irish architect George D. Coleman and is considered his masterpiece.

Tranquil splendour Just before stepping in, spot the tall spire on its roof as well as the Roman Doric columns and pilasters that hold up the much-lauded porticoes. Inside, take a look at the vaulted ceiling and cupola, which are based on traditional Armenian Church architecture. Its tranquil Memorial Garden is good for a stroll. Here, you'll find the tombstones (but not the actual graves) of Agnes Joaquim who hybridised the orchid Vanda “Miss Joaquim” (you might know it as Singapore's national flower), and Catchick Moses, who co-founded the national newspaper The Straits Times.

Dedicated to Mazu, the Goddess of the Sea, early Chinese immigrants came here to give thanks for their safe passage across the rough South China Sea.

It is now permanently exhibited at the National Museum of Singapore  Ornate motifs At the temple, take in the remarkable architecture in the traditional southern Chinese style. Keep an eye out for the detailed carvings and sculptures of dragons, phoenixes and deities, as well as the colourful broken porcelain on the roof ridges, a Fujian decorating technique.

This is, after all, Singapore's largest cathedral and the oldest Anglican house of worship.  Struck by lightning, twice Designed by Colonel Ronald MacPherson in 1856, an executive engineer and superintendent of the Public Works Department, the English Gothic structure replaced the original chapel which was destroyed by not one, but two lightning strikes in 1852. Scottish merchants funded the early construction of the church building, so the church was named after the patron saint of Scotland. Trained Indian convict labourers were involved in the cathedral's construction. In 1942, shortly before the fall of Singapore during World War II, the cathedral was used as an emergency hospital during the frequent air raids. Church service resumed in 1945, after the Japanese surrendered.  Remembering the past Gazetted as a national monument in 1973, the cathedral and its grounds hold a number of memorials and dedications. Among them, the stained glass windows in the apse are dedicated to Singapore's founder, Sir Stamford Raffles; its second British Resident, John Crawfurd; and Straits Settlements Governor, Major-General William Butterworth.

The temple gets its name from what the Buddhists regard as the left canine tooth of Buddha, which has been recovered from his funeral pyre in Kushinagar, India and displayed in its grounds.  Careful design This Tang-styled Chinese Buddhist temple was conceptualised and designed by the temple's Chief Abbot Venerable Shi Fa Zhao, with the help of local and overseas consultants. It cost S$75 million to set up, and is based on the elements of the Tang Dynasty and the Buddhist Mandala, a symbol of Buddhist culture that represents the universe.  Sacred relics and giant stupa The Buddhist Culture Museum on the third floor holds an array of revered artefacts of the Buddha, such as bone and tongue relics, and the Sacred Light Hall on the fourth floor contains the temple's centrepiece. The Buddha Tooth Relic is housed in a giant stupa weighing a whopping 3500 kilograms and made from 320 kilograms of gold, of which 234 kilograms were donated by devotees. You'll have to see the tooth relic from the public viewing area, as only monks are allowed into the relic chamber. Other highlights include the Eminent Sangha Museum, a theatre that holds cultural performances, talks and film screenings.
